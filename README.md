## About

The goal of this project is to write a web API to help select activities to do in Madrid (or any city).

## Test

<<<<<<< HEAD
After a file is posted, a city with that namefile is creAted. I'm not sure when/how to start with reading/parsing the file and create the nested records: should it be a Service, or just use a private method in Cities_controller?

Decided to go for Service, since reading the file is kind of out of the City scaffold scope.
